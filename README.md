<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The goal of this repository is to help you understand the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms and how they are implemented in Python. Each data structure and algorithm in this repository is explained with clear code examples and explanations.
</p>


<h2 id="data-structures">Data Structures</h2>
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. It provides a specific layout and organization for data elements to be stored in memory, allowing for easy and optimized retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data.

Data structures play a crucial role in computer science and programming, as they determine how data is stored and accessed in algorithms and applications. Choosing the appropriate data structure for a specific problem can significantly impact the performance and efficiency of a program.

<h3 id="arrays">Arrays</h3>

<p>Arrays are fundamental data structures that store elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.</p>

<h3 id="linked-lists">Linked Lists</h3>

<p>Linked lists consist of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.</p>

<h3 id="stacks">Stacks</h3>

<p>Stacks are Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structures that allow insertion and deletion of elements only from the top.</p>

<h3 id="queues">Queues</h3>

<p>Queues are First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structures that allow insertion at the rear and deletion from the front.</p>

<h3 id="trees">Trees</h3>

<p>Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes with parent-child relationships.</p>

<h3 id="graphs">Graphs</h3>

<p>Graphs are a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes.</p>

<h3 id="hash-tables">Hash Tables</h3>

<p>Hash tables use hash functions to store and retrieve data in a key-value format.</p>

<h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h2>

<h3 id="searching">Searching</h3>

<p>Searching algorithms are used to find the presence or location of a specific element in a data structure.</p>

<h3 id="sorting">Sorting</h3>

<p>Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending.</p>

<h3 id="recursion">Recursion</h3>

<p>Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.</p>

<h3 id="dynamic-programming">Dynamic Programming</h3>

<p>Dynamic programming is an optimization technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems.</p>

<h3 id="graph-algorithms">Graph Algorithms</h3>

<p>Graph algorithms are used to solve problems related to graphs, such as finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.</p>

<h3 id="greedy-algorithms">Greedy Algorithms</h3>

<p>Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.</p>
